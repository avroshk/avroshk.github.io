        <strong>Grant of License.</strong> This software program is licensed, not sold, to you by GEORGIA TECH RESEARCH CORPORATION ("GTRC"), owner of all copyrights to the software program(the “Program”), for use only under the terms of this License, and GTRC reserves any rights not expressly granted to you.  The Program may include digital images, stock photographs, clip art, fonts, sounds or other artistic works including but not limited to the EarSketch loops ("Stock Files"). <em> You may not modify or create derivative works based upon the Program. </em>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Restrictions on use of Stock Files.</strong> You may create and reproduce works based upon the Stock Files or upon the Stock Files and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Stock Files may be recast, transformed, or adapted (“Derivative Works”), provided that the Derivative Work(s) constitute a good-faith partial or recombined usage employing "sampling," "collage," "mash-up," “remix”, or other comparable artistic technique, whether now known or hereafter devised, that is substantially different from the original, as appropriate to the medium, genre, and market niche. For clarity, the mere synchronization ("synching") of the Stock Files with a moving image shall not be considered a transformation of the Stock Files into something substantially different.

Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. Upon notice from GTRC, you must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to GTRC, as requested.
