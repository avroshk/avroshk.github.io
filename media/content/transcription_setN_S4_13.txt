Speaker 3: Ikea in Atlanta
Speaker 4: do you make yourself for it so I made this instrument last summer I called it like a sound Globe so what it is is it has like a like a ball so imagine like the like the Earth like love that you like spun like when you were a child so it's kind of like that so you spend this ball like that's the kind of like the width of your hand and the speed of that rotation is map to how loud that sounds and with my left hand I'm controlling the pitch using some strip looking a sensor

Speaker 3: young people
Speaker 2: and I really did
Speaker 1: what I was sitting at Nana and Grande really do know a lot
Speaker 2: so last semester takumi joined our program and yeah just like meeting every old and new people and ice on his Facebook I saw the new instrument that he had made any posted a video about it and that's all he did he wasn't just an experimental stuff so I told him do though and I do play Live you should because I thought he is like already probably playing like a famous guy
Speaker 3: (...could not understand...)
Speaker 2: you got to go because you got crazy stuff and then I didn't think of like us playing together back then so I was like in my bedroom making beats at that point of time so yeah he told me like okay you got some beats so let's jam on it I love it and then one day we met and we had a very bad Jam sesh
Speaker 3: (...could not understand...)
Speaker 4: pretty bad we can't we can laugh about it now but I will tell him okay go to the next next weekend since like okay anyway and in like 30 seconds later okay here's the next sequence I like during the live say like you can't like take that long to go to an ex like
Speaker 3: yeah it's like I took my property to Saturday now that okay I can make crazy beats and then I would make those crazy beads and then he late can you do that again and I like it
Speaker 2: in the
Speaker 3: jam session beer
Speaker 2: is that okay
Speaker 3: (...could not understand...)
Speaker 2: is electronic music performance sets its good its
Speaker 1: cats
Speaker 2: it's not so you have your instrument and it's restricted in a way and it's probably and it sounds or the way you can play it but in there that's that's the first thing that intrigues you that okay this is all I can do now what can I get out of it so so you said with it spend some time and get some you know sounds out if it that you like and then second thing would be is instruments the hardware is tremendous like now you have to recreate what you did and that's where the Mastery comes and you know a lot of people think that it's
Speaker 4: (...could not understand...)
Speaker 3: all this late but can you
Speaker 2: push that same button with same intensity of the same timing again it takes a bit of practice and planning and I think that's that's where the Intrigue and electronic music performance lies and you know to be able to recreate the sounds and there as much as an instrument like a violin and guitar for me very well accepted them I guess I really have a lot of fun playing it just the way I would have you on my guitar which I usually do
Speaker 1: add Dart Advantage I guess

Speaker 3: dick in your hand
Speaker 4: is it ranging from like post-rock to just complete you know knots like noise and I Pure Noise like I think it is not in between
Speaker 2: add the most beautiful thing about this scene according to me is that you have this freedom to explore something anything you know you're not bound by the expectation of the audience or deshundra or the sounds like nothing so you basically have complete freedom and no expectation zero expectation from
Speaker 4: which is
Speaker 3: which is better
